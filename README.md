# Benchmark and Simulation Data for Minimum Fault-Tolerant Connected Dominating Set Problem

&nbsp;

## **Benchmark Data**
The benchmark data is in the folder "./instance/", where the file name indicates the number of vertices and density of the undirected graph.

## **Simulation Data**
The simulation data for four different application scenarios is in folder "./instance_bim/", where each folder contains the following files.
- ./1-1 ./2-2 ./3-3: Figures of the simulation results.
- ./bim_data.rvt: Revit file for BIM data.
- ./bim_data.json: SLS algorithm's input extracted from interface language.
- ./fig1.png ./fig2.png: For a quick glance.
